          <h2>Simon Porte Jacquemus</h2>
          <p>Simon Porte Jacquemus is a self-taught designer and the founder of
            fashion label, Jaquemus.
            He was born on January 16, 1990 in Salon-de-Provence, France. In 2008,
            at the age of 18, he went to Paris, where he studied at the École
            supérieure des arts et techniques de la mode for a short time. When his
            mother died, he began his own career as a fashion designer at the age
            of 20.
            <br>
            <br>
            The name "Jacquemus" is derived from his mother's maiden name. His
            collections have been descirbed as "surreal", "playful", "deconstructed", and
            "fresh" as he constantly pays homage to his home of France, and the
            laidback attitude of the people.
